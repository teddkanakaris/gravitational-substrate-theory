# Gravitational Substrate Theory (GST)

**Gravitational Substrate Theory** proposes that spacetime is structured by massive, discrete "field points"â€”not empty vacuum. These field points contribute curvature even in the absence of particles and may explain phenomena traditionally attributed to dark matter and vacuum energy.

## Summary

- Each field point has intrinsic mass (~1e-73 kg)
- Particles are wave-like excitations traveling through the substrate
- Dark matter is reframed as the gravitational effect of empty but massive field points
- Vacuum energy emerges naturally from the field point density and mass
- Gravitational lensing and structure formation occur without exotic matter
