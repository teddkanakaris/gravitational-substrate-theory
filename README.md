# Gravitational Substrate Theory (GST)

**Gravitational Substrate Theory** proposes that spacetime is structured by massive, discrete "field points"—not empty vacuum. These field points contribute curvature even in the absence of particles and may explain phenomena traditionally attributed to dark matter and vacuum energy.

## 🌌 Introduction

What if dark matter isn’t “missing”?  
What if space itself has mass?

Gravitational Substrate Theory (GST) explores this possibility. It suggests that the vacuum of space is filled with invisible field points—submicroscopic locations that carry intrinsic mass. These points create curvature, enable wave-like particle motion, and reframe how we understand gravity, lensing, and the structure of the universe.

This theory was developed through a visual-first approach, guided by lived experience in music, design, and complex systems thinking.

## 📘 Summary

- Each **field point** has intrinsic mass (~1e-73 kg)
- **Particles** are wave-like excitations traveling through this substrate
- **Dark matter** may be the gravitational influence of unoccupied, massive field points
- **Vacuum energy** arises naturally from field point density and geometry
- **Gravitational lensing** and structure formation occur without exotic particles

## 🧠 Challenges & Responses

[Link to full discussion on Substack]([https://teddkanakaris.substack.com/p/challenging-gst](https://substack.com/home/post/p-168236620))

- Why hasn't this mass been directly detected?
- What about the equivalence principle?
- Can it account for cosmic acceleration?
- Is this a modern aether?
