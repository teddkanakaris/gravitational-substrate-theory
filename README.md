# Gravitational Substrate Theory (GST)

**Gravitational Substrate Theory** proposes that spacetime is structured by massive, discrete "field points"—not empty vacuum. These field points contribute curvature even in the absence of particles and may explain phenomena traditionally attributed to dark matter and vacuum energy.

## Summary

- Each field point has intrinsic mass (~1e-73 kg)
- Particles are wave-like excitations traveling through the substrate
- Dark matter is reframed as the gravitational effect of empty but massive field points
- Vacuum energy emerges naturally from the field point density and mass
- Gravitational lensing and structure formation occur without exotic matter
